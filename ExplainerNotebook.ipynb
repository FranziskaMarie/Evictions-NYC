    "The main dataset we are using contains the registered evictions performed in New York City from 2017 until May 10th 2023. We decided to analyze this dataset because of our interest in social phenonemena and our excitement to discover patterns, development and connections to other factors. Evictions can be influenced by many elements and we were interested what impact social and economic situations have on this specific topic, as well as rent prices and living conditions. The American Community Survey (ACS) gathers this information with annual elicitations conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. We are looking at the 5-year-estimates of the latest published years from 2017-2021.\n",
    "With our analysis we want to provide insights into distributions of evictions in NYC and possible correlations between certain factors. The goal is to give an introduction to the topic and let the reader explore the informations further with interacitve plots afterwards."

    "Our main goal was to analyze evictions in New York City. \n",
    "We discovered that COVID-19 has affected the occurrences dramatically. Indeed, it is clear that the legal regulations about stopping evictions strong impact on the development. \n",
    "Looking into economic and housing data we also showed that the rent prices are increasing together with the gross salary and the unemployment percentage is decreasing between 2017-2019 which is probably the driving factor for the decrease in evictions during this period. Finally, we correlated the evictions with economic and demographic data giving insights into industries the people are working in and ethnicities. The analysis showed that more than 35% of people living in the Bronx are working in Educational Services, Healthcare, Social Assistance, while a remarkable point is that in Manhattan where evictions are rathr low, the labor force is mainly working in Finance which is correlated with higher salaries.   \n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to leave out records with exact geo location which is a total of 68207/75443 = 9,6% of the data. We could improve our analysis by using the provided addresses and a package that can turn these to latitudes and longitudes.\n",
    "After the data cleaning the eviction dataset is missing some values for the Building Identification number. We also noticed some human noise in this column since there is a high amount of evictions for buildings with the BIN 2000000 and 3000000 but the addresses and NTA's are not the same. We could improve the analysis using the exact geo locations here as well.\n",
    "Another interesting connection are rates of homeless people in NYC, which could be a topic of future analysis."
