# Evictions-NYC
# Introduction

Evictions have been a hot topic, especially in New York City since they enacted the Tentant Safe Harbor Act to protect tenants who were unbale to pay their rent during Covid-19. For this reason, what this new law involves and how eviction occurrences have been fluctuating over the recent years for the city of New York will be investigated in the following. Tha dataset contains information about evicted properties, is called Evictions dataset and can be found in the Open Data NYC website. Analytically, it contains information about performed evictions from 2017 until now (May 12th 2023) such as their geographic location, the executing marshals who performed them while building information is also provided(i.e. commercial or residential property). For the analysis to be expanded and correlated with other factors that can play a vital role on explaining why and where evictions are taking place, 5-year-estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) that contain housing, economic, social and demographic data will supplement our analysis.


# First plot about covid.

At first glance, anyone can detect that there has been a significant drop in evictions from 2020 onwards. This is related to a law that was enacted on March 7th helping to protect tenants that suffer financial hardship due to Covid-19. Tenants have to affirm in court that they have financial issues caused by the pandemic in order to stop the landlord from evicting them. This law was valid until the 15th of Janunary 2022 which is strongly noticeable in the distribution of figure 1. What is interesting is that there is still a rather low amount of evictions in 2022.
