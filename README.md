# Evictions-NYC
# Introduction

Evictions have been a hot topic, especially in New York City since they enacted the Tentant Safe Harbor Act to protect tenants who were unbale to pay their rent during Covid-19. For this reason, what this new law involves and how eviction occurrences have been fluctuating over the recent years for the city of New York will be investigated in the following. Tha dataset contains information about evicted properties, is called Evictions dataset and can be found in the Open Data NYC website. Analytically, it contains information about performed evictions from 2017 until now (May 12th 2023) such as their geographic location, the executing marshals who performed them while building information is also provided(i.e. commercial or residential property). For the analysis to be expanded and correlated with other factors that can play a vital role on explaining why and where evictions are taking place, 5-year-estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) that contain housing, economic, social and demographic data will supplement our analysis.


# First plot about covid.

At first glance, anyone can detect that there has been a significant drop in evictions from 2020 onwards. This is related to a law that was enacted on March 7th helping to protect tenants that suffer financial hardship due to Covid-19. Tenants have to affirm in court that they have financial issues caused by the pandemic in order to stop the landlord from evicting them. This law was valid until the 15th of Janunary 2022 which is strongly noticeable in the distribution of figure 1. What is interesting is that there is still a rather low amount of evictions in 2022.

The two main aspects that the research is focusing and trying to give a clear interpretation about, is firstly: which are the "hotspot" areas in the city and what is the justification behind that trend and secondly: what is the reason behind why the eviction rates are starting to drop even from 2017 onwards.

As far as the later is concerned, additional information should be retrieved in order to better justify this "trend". In this regard, housing data together with economic data are merged, only to depict the mean household income and how it is distributed over the years. After this inspection, it was founded that household income increases in this period, answering to some extent the reason why evictions have dropped. Adding up to this, one would be interested in viualizing the rent prices over the years. As such, the corresponding information was calculated and plotted, showing that rent prices are also following an upward "trend". This information though, contradicts the main findings that evictions are decreasing. At this point, it is necessary to provide more solid information on the economic state of New York in these years in order to explain eviction incidents. Thus, it was decided to delve into the unmployment rates on those years. After isolating the civilian labor force out of the total population from the supplementary economic dataset, the unemployment rates over the the years were showed. The results reveal that unemployment is decreasing from 2017 to 2019 and then it goes up again following the COVID-19 pandemic. Taking the above into consideration, it can now become more clear, at least to a certain extent,why there is a fall in evictions.

The second aspect of this analysis is to search for "hotspot" areas through the city and analyze them further. As such, first thing is to categorize New York city into boroughs and NTAs(neighborhood tabulation areas).
