# Evictions-NYC
# Introduction

Evictions have been a hot topic, especially in New York City since they enacted the Tentant Safe Harbor Act to protect tenants during Covid-19. What this new law involves and how evictions developed in the recent years will be investigated in the following. For that we will be using the eviction dataset from Open Data NYC. It contains information about performed evictions from 2017 until now (May 12th 2023) with their geographic location, the executing marshals and informations about the building for example if it is commercial or residential. To get even more insight about the areas where most evictions happened, we will use 5-year-estimates from the American Community Survey (ACS) about housing, economic, social and demographic data.

# First plot about covid.

There has been a significant drop in evictions in 2020 which you can see in figure 1. This is related to a law that was enacted on March 7th helping to protect tenants that suffer financial hardship due to Covid-19. Tenants have to affirm in cpurt that they have financial issues caused by the pandemic in order to stop the landlord from evicting them. This law was valid until the 15th of Janunary 2022 which is strongly noticeable in the distribution of figure 1. What is interesting is that three is still a rather low amount of evictions in 2022.
